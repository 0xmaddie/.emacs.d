;; Workaround for the conflict between python.el and python-mode.el
;; https://gitlab.com/python-mode-devs/python-mode/-/issues/105

;; Thomas Lotze
;; @tlotze Â· 2022-09-10

;; FWIW, I experience the two modes to be compatible in the sense that
;; once one of them has been applied to a buffer, it works without the
;; other mode's functionality getting in the way. However, there is
;; the issue of which mode gets applied, and that is non-obvious, to
;; say the least. I'm using Emacs 28.1 and python-mode 6.3.0.

;; The behaviour I observe is that when opening Python files, the
;; python-mode.el variety gets used, as can be seen by the "Py"
;; lighter. However, sometimes Emacs starts using the python.el mode
;; on newly opened files, either right from the start or starting from
;; some seemingly random point during a session. Turns out this has to
;; do with autoloads and registration of definition prefixes:

;; While the loading order of the two files is always such that
;; python-mode.el gets to override things, it doesn't register itself
;; for the "python-" prefix. So when the python-mode function is first
;; accessed, it is autoloaded from python-mode.el if there hadn't been
;; a reason to load python.el earlier. But as soon as something
;; accesses the definition-prefixes hash table for the first time, be
;; it some Emacs code loaded during Emacs start-up or the user
;; triggering completions, python.el is loaded and the python-mode
;; function gets defined or overridden by it, switching the preferred
;; Python mode to the built-in one for the remainder of the session.

;; So here is a suggestion for how to "better override" the built-in
;; Python mode by python-mode.el: register python-mode.el for the
;; "python-" prefix (which is correct anyway as it exports the
;; python-mode function) and do it in such a way that python-mode.el
;; is loaded last when completions on the "python-" prefix are
;; searched. This is what works for me; it needs to be run after the
;; python-mode package has been autoloaded: 

;; (puthash "python-"
;;          (append (gethash "python" definition-prefixes) '("python-mode"))
;;          definition-prefixes)

;; This snippet is derived from the definition of
;; register-definition-prefixes and (in my experience) reliably solves
;; the problem I described. It may be worth adding to python-mode.el's
;; autoloads to achieve a more stable experience for users who install
;; python-mode.el to override the built-in Python mode.. 

(require 'python-mode)
(puthash
 "python-"
 (append (gethash "python" definition-prefixes) '("python-mode"))
 definition-prefixes)
